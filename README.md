# GA_SEI-Project2-War

## Description
This is the game is my version of the classic card game, [War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_(card_game)). It's currently set up to be played in the javascript console. It is currently set up for two players but could possible turned into a game with 3 more more players. 

## Rules
Each player picks a card from the top of their deck and flips it over. The player with the highest of those cards takes all of the cards played in that hand and puts it at the bottom of their deck. If there is a tie, each player draws three cards and flips over the fourth. This round is called "War". As in a normal round, the the one with the highest cards takes all the cards played in that round and puts it at the bottom of their deck. You repeat this process if another tie occurs. A player wins when they either have all 52 cards or ther oponent does not have enough cards to finish a round of War.
